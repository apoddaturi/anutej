# Anutej Poddaturi Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Vercel. It is a clean, fast, and lightweight portfolio template that is optimized for performance. The website is deployed with Vercel and can be accessed at [anutej.com](https://anutej.com).

## Technologies Used

- Framework: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
